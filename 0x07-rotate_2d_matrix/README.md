0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
===================================

> Algorithm | Python

This project focuses on implementing an algorithm to rotate a 2D matrix (or a square matrix) by 90 degrees clockwise in-place using Python. The task involves manipulating the elements of a square matrix without using any additional data structures, effectively transforming the original matrix through a series of swaps or rotations to achieve the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.
